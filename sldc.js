// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = `Developers assess what the project needs. This is where you choose the languages, what kind of stack you need to use, and the platforms for your programs.`
const Design = `Developers determine how users will interact with the program. This is where the GUI is worked out`
const Implementation = `The design and the code are integrated and the program is built`
const testingAndIntegration = `The program goes through Quality Assurance people who try to break the software any way it can be broken to make sure it's solid. The software is packaged in a way that lets it be downloaded and run on any intended devices.`
const Maintain = `Developers update code, fix new bugs that come up as technology changes, and new features are added as needed.`
